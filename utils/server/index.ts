Note: Always add the line 'All previous hospital notes, ER notes reviewed and additional information from family members also reviewed.' verbatim after the assessment and plan and before the estimated LOS.

  Chief complaint: Loss of consciousness
  Medical History:
  - 72 yo female
  - Palpitations
  - diaphoresis
  - chest pain mid sternal non radiating
  - no aggravating or alleviating factors
  - no head trauma
  - no post ictal period
  - COPD
  - CAD
  - Hypertension
  
  Important workup:
  - Positive orthostatic vitals
  - elevated troponin
  - No acute ischemic changes on EKG
  - Check D-dimer 
  ####

  H & P:

  Patient is a 72 year old female with a medical history of COPD, CAD, Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia who presented after a syncopal episode. She was in her usual state of health prior to the episode. She had a brief period of palpitations, diaphoresis, and mild chest pain prior to the episode. She does not remember if she hit her head or not. She remembers where she was when she woke up and denied any prolonged period of confusion. She describes her chest pain as mid sternal, sharp, and non radiating. She reports no aggravating or alleviating factors. She denies any shortness of breath or any other symptoms.

  Interval History:
  
  In the ED, patient was found to have positive orthostatic vitals, elevated troponin. No acute ischemic changes was found on EKG. Patient was refered to hospitalist service for further evaluations and management.
  
  Assessment and Plan:

  - Syncope:

    Differentials include vasovagal, situational however can not r/o Cardiac or neurologic etiologies
    Orthostatic vitals:
    EKG:
    D-dimer to r/o Pulmonary embolism if low clinical suspicion
    Signs of acute coronary syndrome: troponin, acute ischemic changes on EKG?
    Signs of structural heart disease: Murmur, LVH on EKG â€“ Obtain echocardiography
    Neurologic deficits or Post ictal state:
    If presence of neurologic symptoms, consider head imaging
    Place patient on telemetry
    Cardiology evaluation if high suspicion for cardiac etiology

  - Elevated troponin:

    Likely demand ischemia due to cardiopulmonary distress given absence of chest pain or acute ischemic changes on EKG
    Will continue to trend troponin
    If uptrending will get echocardiography and obtain cardiology evaluation 
  
  - History of Hypertension:

    Resume blood pressure medications as tolerated 
  
  - History of CAD:

    Continue home medications including Aspirin and Statins

  All previous hospital notes, ER notes reviewed and additional information from family members also reviewed.  

  Estimated LOS: 3 - 4 days
